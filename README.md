# EasyPromise
The EasyPromise Implementation

# About EasyPromise
This project demonstrates the conceptual and fundamental characteristics of a Promise implementation. Can be used for educational purposes. It can also be used to implement commercial logic.

## Examples

```objectivec
let promise = EasyPromise()
promise.then({
	result in
	// Waiting for a successfully completed process to print a string containing the result of the process.
	print("Success with result : ", result)
	return  "result-2"
}).then({
	result in
	// Waiting for a successfully completed process to print a string containing the result of the process.
	print("Success with result : ", result)

	// Need to return something.
	return  NSNull()
}).catch({
	reason in
	// Waiting for errors as a string containing the reason for the error.
	// This line is entered when a error occurs, in other words,
	// when the function "reject" will be called, the reason for the error will be passed to it as an argument.
	print("Error error with reason : ", reason)

	// Need to return something.
	return NSNull()
})

promise.resolve("result-1");
```
    
### OR in Objective-C style
    
```objectivec
EasyPromise *promise = [[EasyPromise alloc] init];

[[[promise then:^(id result) {
    // Waiting for a successfully completed process to print a string containing the result of the process.
    NSLog(@"Success with result : %@", result); // Success with result : result-0
    return @"result-1";
}]
then:^(id result) {
    // Waiting for the previous process to complete successfully to print a string containing the result of the previous process.
    NSLog(@"Success with result : %@", result); // Success with result : result-1
    
    // Need to return something.
    return  [NSNull null];
}]
catch:^(NSString* reason) {
    // Waiting for errors as a string containing the reason for the error.
    // This line is entered when a error occurs, in other words,
    // when the function "reject" will be called, the reason for the error will be passed to it as an argument.
    NSLog(@"Error error with reason : %@", reason);
    
    // Need to return something.
    return [NSNull null];

}];

[promise resolve:@"result-1"];
```
    
### OR in Swift
    
```swift
let promise = EasyPromise()
promise.then({
	result in
	// Waiting for a successfully completed process to print a string containing the result of the process.
	print("Success with result : ", result)
	return  "result-2"
}).then({
	result in
	// Waiting for a successfully completed process to print a string containing the result of the process.
	print("Success with result : ", result)

	// Need to return something.
	return  NSNull()
}).catch({
	reason in
	// Waiting for errors as a string containing the reason for the error.
	// This line is entered when a error occurs, in other words,
	// when the function "reject" will be called, the reason for the error will be passed to it as an argument.
	print("Error error with reason : ", reason)

	// Need to return something.
	return NSNull()
})

promise.resolve("result-1");
```
